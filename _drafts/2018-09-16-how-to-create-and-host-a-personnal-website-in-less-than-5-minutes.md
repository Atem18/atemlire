You want to build a website ?

You are a DevOps like me that loves to control everything he builds ?

Well, you are in the right place. And even if you are not a DevOps but a lazy person that wants to learn how to self host a modern website, you are are welcomed as well.

Today, we will learn about Jekyll, Forestry, Docker and Datadog.

Be ready, it starts now !

# Jekyll

> **Jekyll** is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator for personal, project, or organization sites.
>
> Instead of using databases, Jekyll takes the content, renders Markdown or Textile and Liquid templates, and produces a complete, static website ready to be served by Apache HTTP Server, Nginx or another web server. Jekyll is the engine behind GitHub Pages, a GitHub feature that allows users to host websites based on their GitHub repositories for no additional cost.
>
> Jekyll is flexible and can be used in combination with front-end frameworks such as Bootstrap, Semantic UI and many others.
>
> Jekyll sites can be connected to cloud-based CMS software such as CloudCannon, Forestry, Netlify or Siteleaf, enabling content editors to modify site content without having to know how to code.
